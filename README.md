# Cryptography Assignment for week 39

Write a command line interface (CLI) application that reads a passphrase as input. 
Then gives the option to either encrypt a message and save it to a file, or read a message from a file, decrypt and show it.

A passphrase is just a string of characters or words. 
Passphrases are longer than usual passwords making them more secure. 
So you can think of a passphrase as essentially just a long password.

This is the project of Lasse Hansen and Anders Bernhard Madsen.
